# ML_Short
A short example of a manual machine learning (ML) workflow taking an anonymized payments dataset through various ML steps. The dataset is labeled with a smaller proportion of payments classified as fraudulent (1).  The dataset has 1004 rows and 12 columns including the labels.  
The goal of this Jupyter Notebook file is to summarize various steps in performing ML programing with Python which at least would provide a deeper understanding of ML, and at best could provide a way to perform ML procedures for additional ways to extract value from audit data.  The ML programming workflow steps include:

1.	Importing libraries
2.	Reviewing the data
3.	Addressing missing values
4.	Transforming non-numerical values into numerical
5.	Splitting the dataset into features & labels
6.	Further splitting the dataset into training and testing
7.	Selecting and fitting the algorithm
8.	Performing baseline predictions using the newly trained model
9.	Evaluating baseline predictions using various metrics
10.	Considering tuning hyperparameters, if needed
11.	Storing and re-using the model with new (unlabeled) data
